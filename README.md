# ReactJS | Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ‚öõÔ∏è

This project explores the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** within the context of React applications. LSP, one of the SOLID principles, states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. By adhering to LSP, you can ensure that your components are interchangeable and that your application behaves predictably.

_In simple terms: Objects can be replaced by their subtypes without affecting the correct execution of the program._

## üõ†Ô∏è What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles that help developers create more maintainable and scalable software:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ‚Äî Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## üéØ Objectives

- Demonstrate how to apply the Liskov Substitution Principle in React components.
- Show how to design components that can be extended and replaced without breaking the application.
- Provide practical examples of how to structure a React project following LSP best practices.

## üìÇ What You'll Find

- **Code Example**: React components that adhere to LSP, ensuring safe substitution of components.
- **Component Interchangeability**: Techniques for designing interchangeable components that respect LSP.
- **Best Practices**: Tips for maintaining a predictable and robust codebase by following LSP.
